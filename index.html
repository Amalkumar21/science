      <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        AI has become a catchall term for applications that perform complex tasks that once required human input, such as communicating with customers online or playing chess. The term is often used interchangeably with its subfields, which include machine learning (ML) and deep learning.
        <br><br>
    There are differences, however. For example, machine learning is focused on building systems that learn or improve their performance based on the data they consume. Itâ€™s important to note that although all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning.
    <br><br>
    To get the full value from AI, many companies are making significant investments in data science teams. Data science combines statistics, computer science, and business knowledge to extract value from various data sources.

      <h3>What is Agriculture?</h3>
      <p>
        Agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry for food and non-food products.[1] Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. 
        <br><br>
        While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago.
        <br><br>
 The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials (such as rubber). Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, cooking oils, meat, milk, eggs, and fungi.
